# Financial Control System

This system contains a basic control of the financial system. With this system, you can:

- Register Contributions
- Register Debts
- Register Entries
- Register Expenses

On the home page, you can easily view your debts and take action to manage them, including making payments and deleting them.

Feel free to add more features as needed, and I will assist with corrections and improvements.
Please note that the balance calculation is not currently functioning correctly. If you have the expertise to do so, we welcome any efforts to troubleshoot and improve the program.
